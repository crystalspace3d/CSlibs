Compiling Stuff
---------------

Required tools:
- MSVC 7,7.1,8
- Recent MSYS/MinGW
- InnoSetup >= 5.0.7
- Python

The solutions in the projects directory should be built in the following
order:
- CSlibs.sln with VC7.1, target "build_base"
- CSlibs_vc7.sln with VC7.0, "Build All"
- CSlibs_vc8.sln with VC8.0, "Build All"
- CSlibs.sln again with VC7.1, "Build All"

The MinGW-only libs can be built by running build_mingw.sh.

The WineTool in source/tool/winetool currently has to be built from Linux.

Finally, to copy the headers to the location where they are needed for setup
generation, run copy_headers.sh.

To create the setup file:
- Build projects\setuptool.sln
- Run pyimportlib.cmd <python-dir> NN
  where NN is the Python version you have installed (e.g. 24)
- Compile the .iss files in source\setup with InnoSetup in the following order:
  VCsupport, Cygwinsupport, MSYSsupport, CopyDLLs, Crosssupport, binaries
