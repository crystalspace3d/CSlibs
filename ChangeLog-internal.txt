0.99r0_004 (2004-12-20):
  - Rewrote UnixToWine() and WineToUnix() helper FNs. Are now in setuptool.dll
    and use Wine functionality.
  - Started to work on "cross-compile support" helper that chmods 
    cslibs-config and symlinks it to a user-specified place. Doesn't work yet,
    tho; don't know how to load winetool.dll.so from ".".

0.99r0_003 (2004-11-01):
  - simplified .rc files by creating a "version resource template", values are
    passed via macros.
  - CS directory name now defaults to CS, not CrystalSpace.
