Compiling Stuff
---------------

Required tools:
- MSVC 7,7.1,8,9
- Recent MSYS/MinGW, with binutils >= 2.16.91
- InnoSetup >= 5.0.7
- Python


The solutions in the projects directory should be built in the following
order:
- msvc/8/CSlibs.sln with VC8.0
- msvc/7/CSlibs.sln with VC7.0
- msvc/71/CSlibs.sln with VC7.1
- msvc/9/CSlibs.sln with VC9.0

The MinGW-only libs can be built by running build_mingw.sh. Some libraries
may need special preparations:
- lib3ds: run ./autogen.sh
- libmng: run unmaintained/autogen.sh, copy makefiles/configure.in to the
	  source root
- libode: run ./autogen.sh
- libcal3d: 
    Run "aclocal && autoconf && autoheader && libtoolize -c && automake".
    For pcre: copy pcre.h.generic to pcre.h, copy pcre_chartables.c.dist to
    pcre_chartables.c.
- libcegui: run ./bootstrap

If you use Cygwin to run above scripts, note that sometimes symlinks are
generated; MinGW doesn't support those, so you should check the source 
directories for links and replace those with copies of the files linked.

To copy the headers to the location where they are needed for setup
generation, run copy_headers.sh.

Last but not least, run the rebase.sh script. Rebasing is not mandatory, but
gives a small performance advantage.

To create the setup file:
- Build projects\setuptool.sln
- For Python <= 2.4: Run pyimportlib.cmd <python-dir> NN
  where NN is the Python version you have installed (e.g. 24)
- Compile the .iss files in source\setup with InnoSetup in the following order:
  VCsupport, Cygwinsupport, MSYSsupport, CopyDLLs, Crosssupport, binaries
