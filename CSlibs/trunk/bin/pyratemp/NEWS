pyratemp 0.3.2 (2013-09-17)
    - default() now also catches AttributeError

pyratemp 0.3.1 (2013-06-17)
    - BUGFIX: prevent pseudo-sandbox-breakouts via lambda/nested code

    - added tools.py to simplify html-/mail-creation

    - added functions to the eval-pseudo-sandbox:
      set(), isinstance(), dir()
    - make list-comprehensions work in the template
      ([.. for .. in ..])
    - make lambda work in parameters with user-defined functions
      (sorted(..., key=lambda x: myf(x[1])))
    - improved error-message for not-allowed-names

pyratemp 0.2.5 (2013-09-17)
    Backport of 0.3.2 to Python <=2.5

pyratemp 0.2.4 (2013-06-17)
    Backport of 0.3.1 to Python <=2.5

pyratemp 0.3.0 (2013-04-03)
    Update notice from 0.2.0:
      Only use this version for Python >=2.6 / 3.x.
      No changes in your templates and your Python-code should be necessary,
      except if you use cmp() / xrange() in your templates.
      Main changes were: Python 3 support, LaTeX/mail-header escaping,
      renamed yaml2pyratemp.py to pyratemp_tool.py, distutils, bugfixes.

    - added Python 3 support
    - removed Python <=2.5 support
    - template-functions: added bytes(), removed cmp() and xrange()

    - escaping: completed LaTeX-escaping
    - escaping: split template-escape() (f_escape()) from internal escape()
      (internal escape does not accept strings as format-parameter and
      doesn't do any unicode-conversion; this is left to f_escape())

    - yaml2pyratemp.py renamed to pyratemp_tool.py
    - pyratemp_tool.py: added --xml to encode output as ASCII + XML-replace

    - added installation via distutils
    - documentation

pyratemp 0.2.3 (2013-04-03)
    Backport of 0.3.0 to Python <=2.5

pyratemp 0.2.2 (2011-05-02)
    - template-functions: default() now also catches TypeError

pyratemp 0.3-pre1 (2010-07-17)
    experimental Python 3 version

pyratemp 0.2.1 (2010-07-09)
    - added escape()-function and mail-header-escaping:
      - escape(s, format=HTML) can now be used in the templates
      - escape now also accepts strings as format-parameter
        (e.g. "HTML", "LATEX", "MAIL_HEADER")
      - added escaping MAIL_HEADER
    - escape() now always returns unicode
    - fixed a error-message-bug, which caused that some error-messages
      displayed an incorrect error-position

pyratemp 0.2.0 (2010-06-15)
  Update notice from 0.1.x:
    no changes to your templates should be necessary,
    and you only need to modify your Python-code if you have used
    the classes StringLoader, FileLoader, PseudoSandbox, TemplateEval
    or TemplateBase directly.

  - added functionality:
    - variables can now be set in the template ("EvalPseudoSandbox.f_setvar()")
    - "dummy-import" ("EvalPseudoSandbox.f_import()")
    - modularized for better extensibility

  - Python-code syntax changes:
    - renamed class StringLoader to LoaderString
    - renamed class FileLoader to LoaderFile
    - unified PseudoSandbox + TemplateEval in EvalPseudoSandbox
    - changed parameter-order of TemplateBase

  - template-syntax minor improvements:
    - check that macro-names are \w+
    - comments (#!...) are now allowed after multi-line-block-tags

  - fixed a minor bug which caused that a function registered in one
    eval-sandbox-instance was available in all instances

  - review, documentation, cleanup

pyratemp 0.1.5 (2009-01-20)
  - fixed a bug (in the parser) which caused that "#!" at the end-of-line
    directly before a single-line-block at the beginning of the next line
    did not remove the newline
    (single-line-blocks now only consume [ \t] instead of \s as P<sSpace>)

pyratemp 0.1.4 (2008-12-21)
  - fixed a bug (in the parser) which caused that substitutions/blocks at the
    beginning of a template after some whitespace raised an exception

pyratemp 0.1.3 (2008-12-20)
  - fixed a bug (in the parser) which caused that empty macros raised an
    exception

pyratemp 0.1.2 (2008-12-19)
  - fixed a problem which caused that single-line-blocks did not work
    after some spaces at the beginning of a line
  - documentation update
  - removed template.txt/template.html from release
  - files renamed according to the "Software Release Practice HOWTO"

pyratemp 0.1 (2008-12-14)
  - initial release
