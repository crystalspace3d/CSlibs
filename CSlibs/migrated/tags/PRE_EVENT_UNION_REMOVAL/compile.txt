Compiling Stuff
---------------

Required tools:
- MSVC 6,7
- Recent MSYS/MinGW
- InnoSetup >= 5.0.7
- Python

If you have VC6, build cal3d for VC6 (libcal3d.dsw) first.

To compile all the libs that come with source, open the solution 
projects\CSlibs.sln and build it.

The MinGW-only libs can be built by running build_mingw.sh.

The WineTool in source/tool/winetool currently has to be built from Linux.

Finally, to copy the headers to the location where they are needed for setup
generation, run copy_headers.sh.

To create the setup file:
- Build projects\setuptool.sln
- Run pyimportlib.cmd <python-dir> NN
  where NN is the Python version you have installed (e.g. 24)
- Compile the .iss files in source\setup with InnoSetup in the following order:
  VCsupport, Cygwinsupport, MSYSsupport, CopyDLLs, Crosssupport, binaries
